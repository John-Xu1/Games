                 <p><ul>

                     <li>Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix Z370-I motherboard, because my person wants to do a lot of CAD and video editing, so tons of memory capacity, it has double capacity memory compatibility â€“ you can have up to 64GB of memory in a relatively small motherboard</li>
                     <li>RAM: G.Skill - Ripjaws Z Series 32 GB (4 x 8 GB) DDR3-1600 Memory, because video editing and CAD requires lots of memory, </li>
                     <li>Storage: Western Digital - Blue 4 TB 3.5" 5400RPM Internal Hard Drive, (4 TB) because video editing requires a lot of storage, also relatively cheap</li>
                     <li>Power Supply: EVGA - SuperNOVA G2 750 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply, because video editing and CAD reuquire relatively high power supply, also has high ratings of effectiveness</li>
                     <li>Cooling System: be quiet! - Dark Rock 4 CPU Cooler, because Sauruv wants a quiet cooler, and it is easy to install</li>
                     <li>GPU: PNY Nvidia Quadro P2000, this graphic card is very popular among CAD users, works well for CAD applications</li>
                     <li>Case: Corsair Air 540 Silver ATX Mid Tower Case, because uses dual chambers to deliver cooler air to your CPU and graphics cards without your drives or power supply getting in the way</li>
                     <li>Display: LG - 25UM58-P 25.0" 2560x1080 60 Hz Monitor, because Sauruv wants good resolution for CAD and editing, and relatively cheap</li>
                     <li>Keyboard: Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad (Wireless, Rechargable) (US English) - Space Gray, because it suits Saruv's tastes in clickiness</li>
                     <li>Mouse: Apple Magic Mouse 2 (Wireless, Rechargable) - Space Gray, looks cool, scrollable in all directions for video editing </li>
                 </ul>
                Price: $1450.84, so it is pretty cheap which Saurav asked for
